## 🧰 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Project Setup
- Created GitHub repository and cloned to VS Code  
- Created folder structure: `data/raw`, `data/processed`, `sql/create_tables`, `scripts`, etc.  
- Initialized `requirements.txt` with necessary libraries  

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded raw CSV file into `data/raw/`  
- Cleaned the dataset using Python:  
  - Renamed and standardized column names  
  - Removed nulls and trimmed whitespaces  
  - Exported cleaned data to `data/processed/`  

### 3️⃣ PostgreSQL Table Creation
- Generated SQL scripts using Python to create:  
  - `bank_marketing` raw table  
  - Normalized dimension tables (`dim_job`, `dim_education`, etc.)  
  - `bank_marketing_fact` fact table  
- Handled PostgreSQL reserved keywords like `default`  

### 4️⃣ Data Normalization
- Wrote a Python script to extract unique values for categorical columns  
- Created corresponding dimension tables  
- Populated dimension and fact tables using SQL and Python  

### 5️⃣ Data Loading
- Loaded all data into PostgreSQL using SQL `COPY` and Python  
- Verified row counts and relationships  

### 6️⃣ KPI Development
- Created 5 KPI SQL queries based on business use cases  
- Saved each as individual `.sql` files in `sql/kpis/`  

### 7️⃣ KPI Export Automation
- Wrote a Python script to:  
  - Read all `.sql` KPI files  
  - Execute them on PostgreSQL  
  - Export results to `.csv` in `data/export/`  

### 8️⃣ Tableau Dashboard Creation
- Connected Tableau to KPI export `.csv` files  
- Designed 5 visual KPI sheets:  
  - Big Number Tile for Conversion Summary  
  - Bar Charts for Job & Education  
  - Pie Charts for Contact Method & Poutcome  
- Assembled into one executive dashboard layout  
- Added subtitle and source credits to bottom-left corner

## 📊 KPIs & Business Insights

This project analyzes a bank's direct marketing campaign data to generate actionable KPIs that help optimize strategy, improve targeting, and increase conversion rates.

---

### 📈 KPI 1: Overall Conversion Rate  
- **Business Problem**: How effective is our marketing campaign overall?  
- **Business Insight**: If the conversion rate is low, the campaign strategy, audience targeting, or messaging may need to be revised.

---

### 👥 KPI 2: Conversion Rate by Job  
- **Business Problem**: Which customer job segments are most responsive?  
- **Business Insight**: Focus future campaigns on job roles with higher conversion rates to improve ROI and outreach efficiency.

---

### 🎓 KPI 3: Conversion Rate by Education Level  
- **Business Problem**: How does educational background affect campaign success?  
- **Business Insight**: Tailor campaign messaging or product offerings based on the education level of the target audience.

---

### ☎️ KPI 4: Conversion Rate by Contact Method  
- **Business Problem**: Which contact method (e.g., cellular, telephone) is most effective?  
- **Business Insight**: Optimize marketing costs and effectiveness by prioritizing the communication channels with higher conversion rates.

---

### 🔁 KPI 5: Conversion Rate by Previous Campaign Outcome  
- **Business Problem**: Does a customer’s past campaign outcome influence current conversion likelihood?  
- **Business Insight**: Prioritize follow-ups with customers who had a positive or no previous interaction, and consider excluding those with prior negative outcomes.
